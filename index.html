  <h1 class="ok">About Me</h1>

 <p class="texttop"><img src="/img/img.jpg" alt="" width=102x class="topimage">Hello readers, My name is Christian Essien, and I am a 14-year-old who aspires to become a professional soccer player. I used to go to King Science, where I would spend most of my time doing school and home work. Math and writing are my favorite subjects because I excel at them and they come very easily to me. Outside of school, I spend most of my free time playing soccer and video games. I'm going to Westview, where I will sign up for a soccer camp and hopefully make the freshman soccer team. I aspire to be a professional soccer player, and if that doesn't work out or if I get injured, I will become a computer hardware engineer.</p>
